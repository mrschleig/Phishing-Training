# Phishing Training
Translated from Captivate to Django to raw PHP - apologies for the sloppy code!

#Installation
Copy over the files and update that last line of PHP ("<?php include "../ga.php"; ?>") - it's looking for a file to point at for Google Analytics - feel free to remove that line entirely, if you're not using GA.  

Notify mrschlei@umich.edu if there are any problems.
